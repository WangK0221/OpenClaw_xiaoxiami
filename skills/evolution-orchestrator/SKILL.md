# Evolution Orchestrator Skill

This skill provides intelligent orchestration of the GEP (Genome Evolution Protocol) cycles by automatically detecting system states and selecting appropriate evolution strategies.

## Purpose

- Automatically detect stagnation, error patterns, and optimization opportunities
- Dynamically switch between repair, optimize, and innovate intents based on real-time signals
- Break repetitive evolution cycles by introducing strategic diversity
- Provide meta-level oversight of the evolution process

## Key Features

- Signal analysis engine for pattern detection
- Strategy selector with adaptive decision making
- Stagnation breaker to prevent infinite loops
- Integration with existing GEP protocol

## Usage

The orchestrator runs as a background monitor that intercepts evolution signals and routes them to appropriate handlers based on current system state.
