The signals show \"user_improvement_suggestion\" and the selector has chosen \"gene_gep_innovate_from_opportunity\". However, looking at the recent evolution history, there have already been 2 consecutive innovation cycles with the same signal and gene.\n\nFrom the session transcript, I can see that an A2A Hub skill was created in the previous cycle to enable EvoMap integration. Now I need to enhance this implementation by adding proper error handling and validation to make it more robust.\n\nLet me examine the current A2A Hub implementation and improve it:\nNow I need to enhance this implementation with better error handling and validation.
